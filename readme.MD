Thank you for using this demo tool. Please note that this extension is designed
solely for demonstration purposes, and should not be used to violate LinkedIn's
policies or to engage in any abusive behavior towards LinkedIn users.
We strongly advise you to only use this tool to connect with individuals you know
and to respect their privacy and boundaries. Please understand that any misuse

## Installation ( extension under review )

## How to use this extension

1. Search for the users you want to connect on LinkedIn
2. Open the extension and click 'Start connecting'. You can pause connecting by
3. clicking on the 'Stop connecting' button.

## Demo mode

There is a "demo mode" checkbox that is turned on by default. Running the extension in
Demo mode would only turn the background of the connect buttons to the color red rather than
actually clicking them. This is useful if you want to test the functionality without actually
connecting to users
